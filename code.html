        <div id = "general2">I recently completed an internship at DreamWorks, where I had the awesome opportunity to work with their Crowds Department! I worked on designing and writing a set of automated tests for the tools in the Crowds pipeline.</div><br>

    	<div id = "general2">I worked as a programmer in RPI's <a class="gen" href="http://panda.cogsci.rpi.edu/" target='_blank'>Perception & Action Lab</a> from May 2013 - May 2014. During my time there, I  contributed to a variety of VR experiments studying human perception, reaction, and locomotion. These experiments were written in C++, Python, and OpenGL and linked to Vicon Motion Capture and Intersense Motion Tracking systems for data collection.</div><br>

        <div id = "general2" style="font-style: italic;">Perception & Action Lab, RPI</div>
        <div id = "general2">I developed a pipeline and tutorials for members of the P&A Lab to create animated versions of their experiments. This involved teaching them basic skills in Autodesk Maya and MotionBuilder, such as how to apply motion capture data to a 3D character. I also wrote a MEL script to transfer the recorded behavior of an obstacle in an experiment to its counterpart in the animated version.</div>
